👋 Hi, I’m Timur

Welcome to my little GitHub!

👀 I love writing silly scripts, making webapps, and generally tinkering with whatever I can get my hands on. My projects range from actually useful tools to questionable experiments that seemed like a good idea at 2 AM.

💻 Languages I (attempt to) use:
I dabble in Python, JavaScript, BASH, and PowerShell, though admittedly, my skills are somewhere between "enthusiastic novice" and "chaotic moron."

Python: It's my go-to for quick and dirty scripts. Sometimes, they even work as intended.

JavaScript: I write code that breaks, learns, and eventually (maybe) works!

HTML & CSS: I make websites look almost professional... if you squint hard enough.

📫 How to reach me:

Email me at timur.gab@gmail.com. Whether you have a cool idea, need help with something, I’d love to hear from you!

✨ Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to browse through my repos, just don’t judge my commit messages too harshly.
