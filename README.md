ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Timur

ðŸ‘€ I love writing useless scripts, making webapps, and generally tinkering with whatever I can get my hands on. My projects range from actually useful tools to questionable experiments that seemed like a good idea at 2 AM.

ðŸ’» I dabble in Python, BASH, JS, and have recently developed an unhealthy obsession with Svelte. I also have an interest in cryptography, but struggle with mathematical concepts of that field.  

âœ¨ Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to browse through my repos, just donâ€™t judge my commit messages too harshly. If you have any questions or something doesn't work, open an issue!
