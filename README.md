ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Timur
Welcome to my little GitHub!

ðŸ‘€ I love writing silly scripts, making webapps, and generally tinkering with whatever I can get my hands on. My projects range from actually useful tools to questionable experiments that seemed like a good idea at 2 AM.

ðŸ’» Languages I (attempt to) use:
I dabble in Python, JavaScript, BASH, PowerShell and occasionally Node.js, though admittedly, my skills are somewhere between "enthusiastic novice" and "chaotic moron."

Python: It's my go-to for quick and dirty scripts. Sometimes, they even work as intended.
JavaScript: I write code that breaks, learns, and eventually (maybe) works!
HTML & CSS: I make websites look almost professional â€“ if you squint hard enough.
Node.js: It's a love-hate relationship, but we make it work... eventually.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
Email me at timur.gab@gmail.com. Whether you have a cool idea, need help with something, or just want to chat, Iâ€™d love to hear from you!

âœ¨ Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to browse through my repositories â€“ just donâ€™t judge my commit messages too harshly.
