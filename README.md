👋 Hey, I’m Timur

I write scripts that probably shouldn’t exist, build webapps no one asked for, and generally poke at anything that looks tinkerable. My repos swing wildly between actually useful tools and experiments that definitely started with the words “okay but what if...”

💻 I bounce between Python, BASH, and JS... but lately Svelte5 (Svelte-Kit) has taken full custody of my attention. I also enjoy cryptography enough to suffer through its math, usually with a lot of pausing and re-Googling involved.

🔐 I’ve spent most of my adult life in the physical security world, where I now curate an industry newsletter called [The Physical Layer](https://layer0.news). It’s like peeling back the curtain on the stuff people walk past every day without noticing.

✨ Anyway... welcome to my little corner of GitHub. Feel free to dig through the repos... ignore the commit messages... and open an issue if something explodes or confuses you. Odds are I confused myself first.
