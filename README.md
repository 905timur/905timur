# 👋 Hey, I’m Timur

I write scripts that probably shouldn’t exist, build web apps no one asked for, and generally poke at anything that looks tinkerable.

## 🍽 dishTXT
I created **[dishtxt.lol](https://dishtxt.lol)** to un-shittify the recipe space. Tired of pop-ups and autoplay just to read a recipe, I built a minimalist aggregator: clean, structured recipes with no nonsense. This project is still in development.

## 📰 The Physical Layer
I curate **[The Physical Layer](https://layer0.news)**, an industry newsletter peeling back the curtain on the infrastructure and systems people walk past every day.

## 💻 Some of my more useful projects:
- [**Reddit Content Cleaner**](https://www.github.com/905timur/reddit-content-cleaner) – automate managing your Reddit account  
- [**Dockyard**](https://www.github.com/905timur/dockyard) – a terminal-based Docker container manager built specifically for resource limited VPS servers. It provides real time insights into your containers with minimal overhead.

I bounce between Python, Rust, Bash, and JavaScript, but lately **SvelteKit** has taken full custody of my attention.  

✨ Welcome to my corner of GitHub—dig through the repos, ignore the commit messages, and open an issue if something explodes. Odds are I confused myself first.
