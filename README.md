Hi, I’m Timur

This is where I keep things I’m working on, things I broke, and things that were never supposed to turn into projects.

I mostly build small tools and web apps that solve annoyances I’ve run into myself. Some of them are useful. Some of them are experiments that got out of hand. If something breaks, open an issue.

dishTXT

I’m building dishtxt.lol to strip recipes down to what people actually want: ingredients and instructions. No pop-ups, no autoplay videos, no life story before the measurements. It’s a minimalist recipe aggregator focused on clean, structured content. Still in active development, currently in the process of switching from serving scraped recipes to hosting my own db. 

The Physical Layer

I curate The Physical Layer, layer0.news, a newsletter about the physical security infrastructure people depend on but rarely notice. Networks, systems, hardware, and the practical realities underneath modern software.
